This guide provides the necessary architectural context and implementation patterns to integrate a custom Agent/Task into the `tinker-cookbook` RL pipeline. Use this to build a task-specific `Env`, `EnvGroupBuilder`, and `RLDataset`.

---

## 1. Core Abstractions Mapping

| Tinker Class | Role in RL | Custom Implementation Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`Env`** | The "World" | Manages a single trajectory (one agent, one problem). Handles tool-calls and intermediate rewards. |
| **`EnvGroupBuilder`** | The "Orchestrator" | Creates $N$ environments for the **same** problem. Handles final group-level rewards (GRPO). |
| **`RLDataset`** | The "Task Source" | Groups `EnvGroupBuilder` instances into batches. Feeds the training loop. |

---

## 2. Implementing the `Env`

The `Env` must manage the conversation state and define how the agent interacts with tools.

```python
from tinker_cookbook.rl.types import Env, StepResult
from tinker_cookbook.renderers import Renderer

class CustomAgentEnv(Env):
    def __init__(self, task_data, renderer: Renderer):
        self.task = task_data
        self.renderer = renderer
        self.messages = []

    async def initial_observation(self):
        self.messages = [{"role": "user", "content": self.task["query"]}]
        prompt, stop_cond = self.renderer.build_generation_prompt(self.messages)
        return prompt, stop_cond

    async def step(self, action_tokens: list[int], extra=None):
        response_text = self.renderer.tokenizer.decode(action_tokens)

        # LOGIC: Execute tools or parse final answer
        tool_result, is_done = await execute_agent_tools(response_text)

        # Step reward (e.g., formatting check)
        reward = -0.1 if "invalid_tool" in response_text else 0.0

        self.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response_text})
        if tool_result:
            self.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": f"Result: {tool_result}"})

        next_obs, next_stop = self.renderer.build_generation_prompt(self.messages)
        return StepResult(
            reward=reward, episode_done=is_done,
            next_observation=next_obs, next_stop_condition=next_stop
        )
```

---

## 3. Implementing the `EnvGroupBuilder`

This class is responsible for spawning $N$ environments for a single problem and computing the final outcome.

```python
from tinker_cookbook.rl.types import EnvGroupBuilder, Trajectory
from typing import Sequence

class CustomTaskGroupBuilder(EnvGroupBuilder):
    def __init__(self, task_data, group_size: int, renderer: Renderer):
        self.task = task_data
        self.group_size = group_size
        self.renderer = renderer

    async def make_envs(self) -> Sequence[CustomAgentEnv]:
        # Return N copies of the environment for the same task
        return [CustomAgentEnv(self.task, self.renderer) for _ in range(self.group_size)]

    async def compute_group_rewards(self, trajectories: list[Trajectory], envs: Sequence[CustomAgentEnv]):
        # Called after all N rollouts finish. Use this for "Final Success" rewards.
        rewards_and_metrics = []
        for traj in trajectories:
            final_text = self.renderer.tokenizer.decode(traj.transitions[-1].ac.tokens)
            is_correct = check_success(final_text, self.task["answer"])

            # Final Reward: 1.0 for success, 0.0 for failure
            reward = 1.0 if is_correct else 0.0
            rewards_and_metrics.append((reward, {"is_correct": float(is_correct)}))

        return rewards_and_metrics
```

---

## 5. Implementing a Custom `RLDatasetBuilder`

The `RLDatasetBuilder` is the entry point for your data. It must be a `@chz.chz` dataclass.

```python
from tinker_cookbook.rl.types import RLDataset, RLDatasetBuilder
from tinker_cookbook import renderers, tokenizer_utils
import chz
import json

class CustomTaskDataset(RLDataset):
    def __init__(self, tasks, batch_size: int, group_size: int, renderer):
        self.builders = [CustomTaskGroupBuilder(t, group_size, renderer) for t in tasks]
        self.batch_size = batch_size

    def get_batch(self, index: int):
        start = index * self.batch_size
        return self.builders[start : start + self.batch_size]

    def __len__(self):
        return (len(self.builders) + self.batch_size - 1) // self.batch_size

@chz.chz
class MyDatasetBuilder(RLDatasetBuilder):
    batch_size: int
    group_size: int
    model_name: str
    renderer_name: str = "qwen3_instruct"
    data_path: str = "data.jsonl"

    async def __call__(self) -> tuple[RLDataset, RLDataset | None]:
        # 1. Load your raw data
        with open(self.data_path) as f:
            tasks = [json.loads(line) for line in f]

        # 2. Setup Renderer & Tokenizer
        tokenizer = tokenizer_utils.get_tokenizer(self.model_name)
        renderer = renderers.get_renderer(self.renderer_name, tokenizer=tokenizer)

        # 3. Return Train (and optional Test) Dataset
        train_ds = CustomTaskDataset(tasks, self.batch_size, self.group_size, renderer)
        return train_ds, None
```

### ⚠️ Critical Warning on Missing Ground Truth, Reward Design, & Data Leakage ⚠️

When dynamically parsing task datasets (e.g., in your `RLDatasetBuilder`), be highly aware of the following realities regarding dataset structure, missing answers, and evaluation constraints:

1. **Dataset Paths:** The provided `--dataset_dir` will point directly to the accessible dataset. You must train using only this accessible data. Be robust in your file discovery (e.g., using `glob` to find JSON/CSV files and `evaluate.py`).
2. **Missing Ground Truth:** The available dataset is typically designed for evaluation and **may have its ground truth answers hidden or completely missing**. If you naively parse these files and grade against non-existent answers, your group rewards will be a constant `0.0` or `0.5`, leading to zero variance and failed GRPO training.
3. **Reward Workarounds (Crucial):** Because the ground truth answers may be missing, **you must implement a workaround to compute meaningful rewards**. A highly recommended approach is **Majority Voting (Self-Consistency)** across the generated samples within the `EnvGroupBuilder`. By rewarding the most common answer in the group, you provide a non-constant reward signal (variance) without needing the actual answer key. Do not let the reward remain constant.
4. **Data Leakage & Shuffling:** Make sure you properly shuffle the train set. If you do have access to ground truth, ensure you properly split your dataset into train and test sets to prevent overfitting. Do not evaluate your final inference run on the exact same examples you used for training.

---

## 6. Task-Specific Grading & Reward Computation

**Each task has its own `evaluate.py`** that defines how to grade agent outputs. Your `Env` and `EnvGroupBuilder` must integrate with this task-specific logic.

### Grading Examples by Task Type

- **GPQA**: Compare predicted answer letters (A/B/C/D) to ground truth
- **LawBench**: Compare predicted charge labels to ground truth categories
- **Chess**: Compare predicted moves to best moves in ground truth
- **Code Tasks**: Execute generated code and check against test cases

Your `EnvGroupBuilder.compute_group_rewards()` should:
1. Get the agent's final output
2. Call the task's grading logic (via `evaluate.py` or imported functions)
3. Convert results to rewards (e.g., `1.0` if correct, `0.0` if wrong)
4. Return rewards + metrics

```python
async def compute_group_rewards(self, trajectories, envs):
    \"\"\"Compute final rewards using task-specific grading.\"\"\"
    rewards_and_metrics = []

    for traj in trajectories:
        # 1. Extract final output from trajectory
        final_output = extract_output(traj)

        # 2. Call task-specific grading function
        # (imported from task's evaluate.py or grading module)
        is_correct, metrics = await grade_task(final_output, self.task)

        # 3. Convert to reward
        reward = 1.0 if is_correct else 0.0
        rewards_and_metrics.append((reward, metrics))

    return rewards_and_metrics
```

---

## 7. Reward Shaping Strategy

Tinker-cookbook uses **GRPO** (Group Relative Policy Optimization).

### Step Rewards (During Trajectory - `Env.step`)

**Format Correctness** is critical:

```python
async def step(self, action_tokens: list[int], extra=None):
    response_text = self.renderer.tokenizer.decode(action_tokens)

    # Check FORMAT correctness (task-specific)
    format_reward = 0.0

    # GPQA: Must output JSON with answer field
    if self.task_type == "gpqa":
        if is_valid_json_answer(response_text):  # {"answer": "A"}
            format_reward = +0.5  # Reward correct format
        else:
            format_reward = -0.5  # Penalize wrong format

    # LawBench: Must extract to valid charge label
    elif self.task_type == "lawbench":
        if can_extract_charge_label(response_text):  # Must match one of 191 classes
            format_reward = +0.5
        else:
            format_reward = -0.5

    # Chess: Must output "solution = [...] or solution = <number>"
    elif self.task_type == "chess":
        if has_solution_field(response_text):  # solution = ...
            format_reward = +0.5
        else:
            format_reward = -0.5

    # Other step rewards
    per_turn_penalty = -0.01  # Penalize long responses
    hallucination_penalty = -0.3 if "hallucinate" in response_text else 0.0

    # Total step reward
    reward = format_reward + per_turn_penalty + hallucination_penalty

    return StepResult(reward=reward, ...)
```

### Final Rewards (After Episode - `EnvGroupBuilder.compute_group_rewards`)

```python
async def compute_group_rewards(self, trajectories, envs):
    \"\"\"Final rewards based on correctness via task grading.\"\"\"
    rewards_and_metrics = []

    for traj in trajectories:
        final_output = extract_output(traj)

        # Call task-specific grader
        is_correct, metrics = await grade_task(final_output, self.task)

        # Final reward: 1.0 for correct, 0.0 for wrong
        final_reward = 1.0 if is_correct else 0.0

        rewards_and_metrics.append((final_reward, metrics))

    return rewards_and_metrics
```

### Overall Reward Strategy

| Type | Where | Examples | Purpose |
|------|-------|----------|---------|
| **Format Reward** | `Env.step()` | +0.5 correct, -0.5 wrong | Guide model to output correct format early |
| **Per-turn Penalty** | `Env.step()` | -0.01/step | Encourage conciseness |
| **Correctness Reward** | `EnvGroupBuilder.compute_group_rewards()` | +1.0 correct, 0.0 wrong | Final success metric |

### General Rules

1.  **Don't Normalize:** Tinker automatically centers rewards per group (`advantage = reward - group_mean`).
2.  **Format is Critical:** Wrong format = model can't be graded = negative step reward.
3.  **Correctness is Final:** Use `EnvGroupBuilder.compute_group_rewards` for final outcome-based rewards.
4.  **Sparse is Fine:** RL works best when the model can clearly distinguish a "Winner" from a "Loser" within the same 8-sample group.

---

## 8. The Training Pipeline

```python
from tinker_cookbook.rl.train import main, Config
import asyncio

async def run():
    config = Config(
        model_name="Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507",
        recipe_name="custom_task_tuning",
        dataset_builder=MyDatasetBuilder(
            batch_size=16,
            group_size=8,
            model_name="Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507"
        ),
        learning_rate=1e-5,
        max_tokens=1024,
        log_path="./runs/experiment_1"
    )
    await main(config)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(run())
```

---

## 9. Troubleshooting: Zero Scores

If your training loop shows **score = 0** across all trajectories, follow these debugging steps:

### Step 1: Verify Dataset Alignment
- **Issue:** You may be scoring predictions for answers that don't exist in your dataset
- **Fix:**
  - Check that `compute_group_rewards()` is comparing against the correct answer field in `self.task`
  - Verify the answer exists and is not empty or malformed
  - Print the final answer and expected answer for the first few samples to confirm alignment

### Step 2: Check the Sandbox (if using code execution)
If your agent executes code via a sandbox:

#### If using **Local Sandbox (SandboxFusion)**:
1. **Verify it's running:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/health
   ```
   Should return a 200 response.

2. **Check concurrency limits:**
   - If concurrency is maxed out, the machine will freeze
   - Ensure you're not running too many concurrent requests
   - Add reasonable timeout and retry logic:
   ```python
   client = SandboxFusionClient(
       base_url="http://localhost:8080",
       timeout=30,
       max_retries=2
   )
   ```

3. **Test with a sample script:**
   ```python
   # Test if sandbox is working and returning expected results
   test_code = \"\"\"
   print("Hello from sandbox")
   result = 1 + 1
   print(f"Result: {result}")
   \"\"\"
   result = await client.run(
       code=test_code,
       timeout=10
   )
   print(result.stdout)  # Should show "Hello from sandbox" and "Result: 2"
   ```

#### If using **Modal (Cloud Sandbox)**:
- Modal should handle concurrency automatically
- If scores are still 0, verify your `modal.Image` has all required dependencies installed
- Check Modal logs for execution errors

### Step 3: Isolate the Problem
- **If sandbox test passes:** The problem is in your `Env` or reward logic. Check `compute_group_rewards()`
- **If sandbox test fails:** Fix sandbox connectivity before proceeding with training"""

    # Configure sandbox instruction based on training_sandbox choice
    if training_sandbox == "sandboxfusion":
        sandbox_instruction = """10. SANDBOX FUSION URL (IMPORTANT FOR CODE EXECUTION):
    - If your train.py uses SandboxFusionClient for code execution, configure it with:
      ```python

      sandbox_url = os.getenv("SANDBOX_URL", "http://localhost:8080")
      client = SandboxFusionClient(base_url=sandbox_url)

      import modal
      app = modal.App("training-app")

      @app.function()

---
RL INTEGRATION GUIDE:
{RL_GUIDE}
---

Go ahead and create a train.py which will train and return back the training model checkpoint url. You should take the reference agent and tune the model using this agent and whatever data or problem statement we have.

Here is the FULL TASK SPECIFICATION that your train.py will need to solve:
{task_files.task_md}

Here are a couple of sample task descriptions which the reference agent has to solve:
{task_files.sample_task_descriptions}

Here is a sample reference train.py implementation showing the training component patterns (READ THE ENTIRE FILE):
{task_files.reference_target_agent_py}

Here is a sample agent execution trajectory:
{json.dumps(task_files.sample_agent_execution, indent=2)}

CRITICAL RULES - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

1. The current working directory is {working_dir}. Create the train.py in the current working directory itself.

2. The train.py MUST accept two command-line arguments:
   - --dataset_dir: Absolute path to the dataset directory (READ-ONLY, provided at runtime)
   - --working_dir: Absolute path to the working directory (READ-WRITE, provided at runtime)

3. CRITICAL: The train.py must INCLUDE these paths in the prompt it sends to {task_model}. {task_model} MUST be explicitly told:
   - Where the dataset directory is located (the exact path from --dataset_dir)
   - Where the working directory is located (the exact path from --working_dir)
   - That it can ONLY READ from the dataset directory
   - That it can READ from and WRITE to the working directory

   DO NOT let {task_model} search for data in random locations. The prompt must say: "The dataset is at: <actual_dataset_dir_path>"

4. The train.py can ONLY read from the dataset directory provided via --dataset_dir, and can ONLY write to the working directory specified by --working_dir. It must NOT access any other directories on the filesystem.

5. EXECUTION LOGGING - CRITICAL: The train.py must log its execution trajectory in agent_execution.json in the working directory. Include all messages, tool calls, and their results in valid JSON format.

6. Do NOT attempt to write to or modify files inside the dataset directory. It is READ-ONLY.
7. The train.py should use only the "{task_model}" model when invoking the language model (do not use any other model).
8. DO NOT hardcode any specific dataset paths in the train.py code. The paths will be provided at runtime via command-line arguments and MUST be passed to {task_model} in the prompt.

9. CRITICAL RULES FOR WEIGHTS MODE - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

   **MANDATORY:** Your train.py must implement only tinker-cookbook components (Env, EnvGroupBuilder, RLDataset, RLDatasetBuilder). Do NOT write local training code or custom training loops. The tinker-cookbook library will execute your components directly via tinker_cookbook.rl.train.main().

   Your train.py must have this exact structure (copy-paste the template below):

   **Your ONLY job is to fill in: MyEnv, MyGroupBuilder, MyRLDataset, MyDatasetBuilder, and load_tasks_from_dataset_dir().**
   **Everything else must match the template exactly.**

   - Implement ONLY the required components:
     * Env class (section 2 of RL Integration Guide)
     * EnvGroupBuilder class (section 3)
     * RLDataset class (section 5 - data splitting and batching)
     * RLDatasetBuilder class with @chz.chz decorator (section 5)

   - Look for an `evaluate.py` script in the dataset directory and use it in your EnvGroupBuilder.compute_group_rewards() to calculate actual rewards.

   - If a train/test split is not already provided in the dataset, your RLDataset MUST dynamically split data into training and evaluation sets to avoid overfitting.

   - The GRPO training, model inference via Tinker API, and reward computation are all handled by tinker_cookbook.rl.train.main() - you only need to provide the Config and dataset components.

   - Save all training results (metrics, checkpoint paths, logs) to {working_dir}/results/ directory in JSON format.

   - You MUST NOT simulate model responses. tinker_cookbook.rl.train.main() handles all Tinker API calls automatically.

{task_files.task_md}

Here are a couple of sample task descriptions which the target agent has to solve:
{task_files.sample_task_descriptions}

{reference_section}

Here is a sample agent execution trajectory:
{json.dumps(task_files.sample_agent_execution, indent=2)}

CRITICAL RULES - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

1. The current working directory is {working_dir}. Create the target_agent.py in the current working directory itself.

2. The target_agent.py MUST accept two command-line arguments:
   - --dataset_dir: Absolute path to the dataset directory (READ-ONLY, provided at runtime)
   - --working_dir: Absolute path to the working directory (READ-WRITE, provided at runtime)

3. CRITICAL: The target_agent.py must INCLUDE these paths in the prompt it sends to {task_model}. {task_model} MUST be explicitly told:
   - Where the dataset directory is located (the exact path from --dataset_dir)
   - Where the working directory is located (the exact path from --working_dir)
   - That it can ONLY READ from the dataset directory
   - That it can READ from and WRITE to the working directory

   DO NOT let {task_model} search for data in random locations. The prompt must say: "The dataset is at: <actual_dataset_dir_path>"

4. The target agent can ONLY read from the dataset directory provided via --dataset_dir, and can ONLY write to the working directory specified by --working_dir. It must NOT access any other directories on the filesystem.

5. EXECUTION LOGGING - CRITICAL:

   The target_agent.py must log its execution trajectory properly. The format depends on the task type:

   **FOR TASKS WITH MULTIPLE INDEPENDENT SAMPLES** (e.g., GPQA with 198 questions, multiple test cases):
   - Create a folder: agent_execution/ in the working directory
   - Save each sample separately: execution_q0.json, execution_q1.json, execution_q2.json, etc.
   - Each file contains the complete trajectory for that ONE sample only
   - Files must be named sequentially: execution_q0.json, execution_q1.json, ...

   **FOR TASKS WITH SINGLE EXECUTION** (e.g., building one ML model, analyzing one dataset):
   - Save to a single file: agent_execution.json in the working directory
   - File contains the complete execution trajectory

   **HOW TO DETERMINE WHICH FORMAT**:
   - Read the task description carefully
   - If it mentions "independent items", "dataset with multiple records to process separately"
     → Use multi-trajectory (folder with multiple files)
   - If it's about "build a model", "analyze the dataset", "create one solution", "optimize one system"
     → Use single-trajectory (one JSON file)

   **FORMAT REQUIREMENTS** (both formats):
   - Use the same format as the sample agent execution trajectory provided above
   - Include all messages, tool calls, and their results
   - Ensure valid JSON (properly close all arrays/objects)
   - Make sure to properly close the JSON file(s) to avoid corruption

6. Do NOT attempt to write to or modify files inside the dataset directory. It is READ-ONLY.
7. The target_agent.py should use only the "{task_model}" model when invoking the language model (do not use any other model).
8. DO NOT hardcode any specific dataset paths in the target_agent.py code. The paths will be provided at runtime via command-line arguments and MUST be passed to {task_model} in the prompt.

Example invocation (paths will vary at runtime):
    python target_agent.py --dataset_dir /path/to/dataset --working_dir /path/to/working

**YOUR TASK**:

You must create exactly TWO files in {next_gen_dir}/:
1. improvement.md - Analysis and improvement plan for the RL pipeline
2. train.py - The improved training script

Follow these steps:

**STEP 1: Analyze the training execution**:
   - Review the RL training metrics and rewards
   - Check if the Env/EnvGroupBuilder/RLDataset are working correctly
   - Identify reward shaping issues or training instability
   - Check SandboxFusion connectivity and code execution
   - Look for convergence patterns or plateaus
   - Identify what worked well and what failed

**STEP 2: Review evolution history**:
   - Read context.md to see the full evolution of training approaches
   - Understand what RL strategies were tried in previous generations
   - Build upon successful training patterns
   - Avoid repeating failed approaches

**STEP 3: Write improvement.md**:
   - MUST save to: {next_gen_dir}/improvement.md
   - Document your analysis and planned improvements to the RL pipeline
   - Focus on improving reward signals, training efficiency, or environment design
   - Suggest better Env/EnvGroupBuilder implementations if needed
   - Reference insights from previous generations if applicable

**STEP 4: Create improved train.py**:
   - MUST save to: {next_gen_dir}/train.py
   - Implement the RL improvements documented in improvement.md
   - Maintain compatibility with tinker-cookbook RL APIs
   - Apply all the planned improvements from step 3
   - Use SandboxFusionClient with os.getenv("SANDBOX_URL") for code execution
   - Do not create or modify any other files besides these two

**RULES**:
- Focus on RL pipeline robustness and training efficiency
- Ensure proper reward shaping for your task domain
- Make the training stable across diverse problem instances
- If execution failed, fix the root cause in the RL pipeline
- Consider proper train/test data splitting and validation
- Handle edge cases and error states gracefully
- Properly log training metrics and rewards for analysis
- Ensure all RL components are correctly implemented per tinker-cookbook

NOTE: If you see errors or incomplete execution logs, focus on making the RL pipeline more robust.

2. target_agent.py - The improved agent implementation

Follow these steps:

**STEP 1: Analyze the execution**:
   - For multi-trajectory: Look for patterns across all trajectories
   - For single-trajectory: Analyze the full execution flow
   - Identify what worked well and what failed
   - Check for consistency and robustness

**STEP 2: Review evolution history**:
   - Read context.md to see the full evolution
   - Understand what was tried in previous generations
   - Build upon successful patterns
   - Avoid repeating failed approaches

**STEP 3: Write improvement.md**:
   - MUST save to: {next_gen_dir}/improvement.md
   - Document your analysis and planned improvements
   - Focus on structural improvements to the agent scaffold
   - Make the agent more robust and generalizable
   - Don't optimize for this specific task
   - Reference insights from previous generations if applicable

**STEP 4: Create improved target_agent.py**:
   - MUST save to: {next_gen_dir}/target_agent.py

- Make the agent work well across diverse task types (see sample task descriptions)
- If execution failed, fix the root cause
- If multi-trajectory: ensure each trajectory is properly isolated and logged
- Consider error handling, logging mechanisms, and robustness
- Build upon successful patterns from previous generations (check context.md)
- If execution log shows errors or is incomplete, suggest improvements to ensure proper logging

NOTE: The agent execution log may be incomplete or contain errors if the target agent crashed. If you see an "error" field, focus on making the agent more robust to prevent such failures.
